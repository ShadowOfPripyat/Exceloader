# Exceloader
My way to load excel files from panda, and call the things i want. It's basically like a library.

# Usage:
### To load an excel file:

```python
from exceloader import ExcelReader

excel_reader = ExcelReader(C:\\User\\Documents\\file.xlsx)
```

### To get the number of worksheets that the file contains:
```python
print(num_worksheets)
```
